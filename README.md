> A MERN app about Authentication & Authorization

## App Structure
* Signing Up
* Logging In & Out
* Private Routes
* Using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
* Email Verification
* Resetting Passwords
* OAuth Integration ("Log in with Google")
* AWS Cognito Integration (Prebuilt Authentication)


## Authentication vs. Authorization
* Authentication = "Is this user who they're claiming to be?"
* Authorization = "Is this user allowed to do what they're trying to do?"



## Strategies for User Auth:

# Knowledge-based auth - 
	- Examples:
		- passwords
		- PINs
		- secret keys
		- security questions
	- Problems:
		- Reliant on users creating good passwords
		- users can forget
		- Sometimes googleable (for security questions)
		
# Ownership-based auth -
	- Examples:
		- User owns an email address
		- Cell phone
		- OTP fob or apps (Authy)
	- In general, more secure than knowledge-based
	- Problems:
		- Easy to lose!
		- Sometimes reliant on knowledge-based strategies as a back-up

* Multi-factor auth - combines knowledge- and ownership-based strategies

# Biology-based Authentication
	- Examples:
		- Facial recognition
		- Fingerprints
		- Retina scans


## JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)

- Strings that users get from our server when they successfully authenticate
- Encoded JSON objects that contain basic user info
	* Encoded !== Encrypted - 3rd parties can see all the data they contain!
	{
		"userId": "12345",
		"email": "arif@test.com",
		"permissionsLevel": "admin",
	}
- JWTs are PRIVATE! Treat them with care


# The JWT Flow:

1. The user logs in successfully (with username and password)
2. The server uses a secret key to generate a JWT w/ the user's info
3. The server sends JWT to user
4. Our front-end saves this JWT to local storage/cookies/etc.
5. Whenever user makes a server request, they send that token to the server
6. Server verifies that token hasn't been modified, and then checks to make sure that the user is authorized


## Basic Email Verification Process:

1. User clicks "create account"
2. Server receives user data and inserts into DB
3. Server generates random hash that the user can't see
4. Server sends email with link & hash to user's provided email
5. User clicks link w/ hash
6. Front-end verifies hash with server
7. If code is legit, server marks user as verified


## Basic Reset Password Process:

1. User clicks "forgot password" and is taken to a page where they can enter their email
2. User enters email address and submits, sending their email to the server
3. Server sends an email with a password reset hash link to that email address
4. User clicks the link, and goes to a page where they can enter a new password
5. New password is sent to the server along with the reset hash. If hash matches, user's password is reset
6. User logs in with new password
